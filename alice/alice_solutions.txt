grep "[\*]" alice.txt 
grep "\*" alice.txt 
Till above all correct. 

Q. has both 'a' and 'e' in it
grep "[ae]" alice.txt # this one brings either a or e. 
A. grep -E 'a.*e|e.*a' alice.txt # this one says first a then e follows or e followed by a. 


Q. has an 'a' and somewhere later an 'e'
grep "^[^a]" alice.txt # Anyline that does not begin with a. 
A. grep "a.*e" alice.txt  # now it says a followed by zoer or more characters and then an e. 

Q. does not have an 'a'
grep "^[^a]" alice.txt 
A. grep "^[^a]*$" alice.txt # Anything other than a for the whole string. 

Q. does not have an 'a' nor 'e'
grep "^[^e]" "e" alice.txt 
grep "^[^ea]$"  alice.txt  will match from start to end the whole line. 

Q. has an 'a' but not 'e'
I am not able to answer it. 
grep -i -E "^[a-df-z 0-9]*$" alice.txt but this is my best shot. 
i for case insensitive. 

Q. has at least 2 consecutive vowels (a,e,i,o,u) like in the word "bear"
grep -E "[aeiou][aeiou]" alice.txt # simple solution. 
                                   # back refrences cannot be used. 

Q.has at least 3 vowels
grep "[aeiou]" alice.txt 
I don't know. 

Q.has at least 6 characters 6 consecutive i can do . I cannot do other. 
has at exactly 6 characters

Q. all the words with either 'Bar' or 'Baz' in them
grep -i -E "bar|baz" alice.txt 

Q. all the rows with either 'apple pie' or 'banana pie' in them
grep -E 'apple pie|banana pie' alice.txt

Q. Bonus: has a double character (e.g. 'oo')
grep -E '(.)\1' alice.txt . First parantheis capture any character, \1 means 
exactly the same. 


Q. Bonus: Print if the same word appears twice in the same line
 grep -w -P '(\b\w+?\b).*\1' alice.txt
