Names that never belong to more than one cat.
Pussy cat, pussy cat, where have you been?
I’ve been down to London to visit the Queen.
Pussy cat, pussy cat, what did you there?
cats should be dogs. 
But above and beyond there’s still one name left over,
The name that no human research can discover—
But THE CAT HIMSELF KNOWS, and will never confess.
When you notice a cat in profound meditation,
Of the thought, of the thought, of the thought of his name:
His ineffable effable
Deep and inscrutable singular name.
catch should not be be dotch
CATS should be DOGS
