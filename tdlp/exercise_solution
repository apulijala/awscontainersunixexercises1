2) Make a list of files in /usr/bin that have the letter "a" as the second character. 
Put the result in a temporary file.
ls -1 /usr/bin | sed -n -e '/an/ w tmpfile'


3) Delete the first 3 lines of each temporary file. 
sed  -s '1,3 d' file* # when it is any other operaton than print don't use -n option as 
-s to separate files

4) Print to standard output only the lines containing the pattern "an".
sed   -n -s '/an/ p' file* -n option has to be used as it will be /an/

5) 
Make a list of files in /usr/bin that have the letter "a" as the second character. 
Put the result in a temporary file.
ls -1 /usr/bin | sed -n -e '/an/ w tmpfile'

6) A long listing of the root directory, /, is used for input. Create a file holding sed commands that check for symbolic links and plain files. If a file is a symbolic link, precede it with a line like "--This is a symlink--". If the file is a plain file, add a string on the same line, adding a comment like "<--- this is a plain file".

ls -l / |  sed -e '/^l/ i\This is symbolic link' -e '/^-/ i\This is a simple file'
-e lets u type a combination of address and a command. 

7) 
Create a script that shows lines containing trailing white spaces from a file. 
This script should use a sed script and show sensible information to the user.

sed -n -E -e '/ +$/ p' file1 # had to use extended regular expression
